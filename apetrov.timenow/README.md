## About

TimeNow allows you to display system's real date and time.

It uses [moment](http://momentjs.com/) in the background, allowing easy internationalization, with more than 100 languages available.

Also, more than 10 predefined formats for time and date are available, but you can easily use your own just by typing it in the input. Check the [moment format documentation](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/) for further reference.

You can find [the source code of this component on GitHub](https://github.com/aptrov/framerx-timenow).
